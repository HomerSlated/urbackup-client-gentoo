	<longdescription>UrBackup is an easy to setup Open Source client/server backup system, that through a combination of image (currently on Windows only) and file backups accomplishes both data safety and a fast restoration time.
	
	Backups are made while the system is running without interrupting current processes.
	
	UrBackup also continuously watches folders you want backed up in order to quickly find differences to previous backups. Because of that, incremental file backups are really fast.
	
	Your files can be restored through the web interface, via app-backup/urbackup-client or the file manager, while the backups of drive volumes can be restored with a bootable CD or USB-Stick (bare metal restore).</longdescription>
